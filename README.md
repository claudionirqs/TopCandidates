This app was a simple app made to test my Xamarin Forms experience. It was made during my last vacation day. 

It was a great opportunity to recycle my knowledge once I didnâ€™t develop anything in this language for more than 2 years due other priority projects and pandemic.

What did I learn with this challenge? That Good things come to those who wait and Good things come to those who bait! ðŸ˜‰
